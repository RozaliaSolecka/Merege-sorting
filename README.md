## About The Project
The aim of the project was to write a file sorting program using the natural merge method. The natural merge method was used. The tapes are realized in the form of disk files. A block read and write simulation has been implemented that allows you to read and write a single record during sorting. The program allows you to generate records randomly, enter records from the keyboard or load records from a test file. The content of the file is displayed before and after sorting, but it is possible to display it after each sorting phase. When the sort is complete, the number of page reads and writes to disk is displayed, as well as the number of phases.
